# MonkeWardrobe ![all](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/elligurt/MonkeWardrobe/total)
A mod for Gorilla Tag that adds more wardrobes to maps.

**Current Maps:**
- City (Mirror)
- Forest (Gazebo)
- Basement (Entrance)

More maps **will** be added in the future, I just am not sure where to put them, if you have an idea contact me on discord @elligurt




**Known Issues**
- Buttons tend to dissapear, just click where the button would be and it'll appear and put the item on.
