# MonkeWardrobe ![all](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/elligurt/MonkeWardrobe/total)
A mod for Gorilla Tag that adds more wardrobes to maps.

**Current Maps:**
- City (Mirror)
- Forest (Gazebo)
More maps **will** be added in the future, I just am not sure where to put them, if you have an idea contact me on discord @elligurt
